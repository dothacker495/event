							<h3>Promotion Details:</h3>
							<p>I am talking about the promo. This is about some hotel that is promoting some sort of package deal or something. I can't pretend to atually now anything about this as I'm mostly just creating these pages ad then helping the boys code them.</p>
							<p>Everyone is working very hard and I appreciate everyone's effort. This was an interesting project and I'm curious to see how the other businesses and presentations go.</p>
